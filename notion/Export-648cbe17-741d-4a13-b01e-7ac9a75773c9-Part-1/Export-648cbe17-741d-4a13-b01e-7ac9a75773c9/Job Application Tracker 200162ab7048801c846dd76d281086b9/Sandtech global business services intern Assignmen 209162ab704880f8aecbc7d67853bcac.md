            **Focus Areas**
            
            :
            
            Ensure real-time responsiveness and clarity onsite
            
- Addressing Deviations
    - Early identification: Monitor task progress closely; flag delays immediately.:
        
        **Traffic Light System:**
        
        - Green: On track
        - Yellow: Minor delays – mitigation needed
        - Red: Major issue – escalate to leadership
        
        ### Early Warning System
        
        **Automated Alerts**:
        
        - Weekly progress reports showing <90% completion rate
        - Budget tracking alerts at 80% and 95% utilization
        - Registration plateau detection (7 days without growth)
        - Vendor/speaker communication gaps >48 hours
    - **The "At Risk" Protocol:** When a task is marked At Risk, I will take the following steps:
        1. **Assess:** I will immediately connect with the task Owner to understand the root cause and potential impact on other tasks (using the Dependencies column).
        2. **Propose Solutions:** I will work with the owner to brainstorm 1-2 potential solutions. For example, if a vendor is late, can we find a backup? If a task is blocked, who do we need to talk to?
        3. **Escalate Clearly:** If the issue cannot be resolved at our level (e.g., it has a major budget or timeline impact), I will immediately escalate it to the GBS Lead with a concise summary: "Here is the problem, here is the impact, and here are our proposed solutions. We need your decision on X."
        - **Risk Log:** I will maintain a simple Risk Log within our project file to track these issues, ensuring we don't forget them and can learn from them for future events.
        - **Trigger Conditions**:
            - Any task >2 days behind schedule
            - Budget variance >5%
            - Critical vendor/speaker cancellation
            - Registration numbers <70% of target
    - Contingency plans: Have backup vendors, alternative speakers, and flexible budgets.
    - Escalation: Raise critical issues to event manager or leadership promptly.
    - Adjust timelines: Reallocate resources or adjust deadlines as needed without compromising key milestones:
        
        log:
        
        - Issue
        - Owner
        - Mitigation plan
        - Deadline
    - Communication: Maintain transparent communication with all stakeholders about changes or risks.

## Ensuring Successful Execution

- Clear roles and responsibilities: Define who owns each task and decision.
- Regular updates and documentation: Keep records of decisions, contracts, and communications.
- Risk management: Maintain a risk log and mitigation strategies.
- Team collaboration: Foster open communication channels (e.g., Slack, WhatsApp).
- In the final weeks, my most important deliverable will be creating and managing the "Run of Show." This is a minute-by-minute schedule for the event days, covering everything from the first AV check at 7 AM to the final cleanup. It lists who is responsible for what at every moment, ensuring zero confusion.
- **Quality Gates at Each Phase**:
    - **Phase Completion Review**: Cannot proceed to next phase without 90% milestone completion
    - **Stakeholder Sign-off**: Leadership approval required for major changes
    - **Vendor Confirmations**: All critical suppliers must provide written confirmation
    - **Financial Controls**: Budget variance approvals required for >5% deviations
- The day before the event, I will facilitate a full team briefing using the Run of Show document to ensure every team member and key vendor knows their role and responsibilities.
- Post-event review: Conduct a debrief to capture lessons learned and success metrics
    - facilitating a post-mortem meeting (as mentioned in the work plan), we can analyze what worked, what didn't, and capture these insights to make next year's summit even more impactful. This directly supports the long-term goal of establishing Sand Technologies as an industry leader.

### What Success Looks Like

- 85% of invitees show up
- Zero major logistical issues
- 40% attendee engagement with post-event follow-up
- At least 10 qualified business opportunities identified

- **Duplicates**: No duplicate Candidate ID or names detected.
- **Missing Data**: Noted missing values in city_of_residence (e.g., Anthony Wilcox), whatsapp_no, and skills for some candidates. Assumed missing skills mean no specific skills listed.
- **Inconsistencies**: Standardized Years of Experience (used employment_experience_years where available, otherwise Years of Experience). Corrected outliers (e.g., Theresa Fox’s 110 years adjusted to 11 based on context).
- **Derived Fields**: Calculated age where missing using date_of_birth and current date (June 7, 2025).
