# Infrastructural and computational challenges facing AI development in Africa.

1. **Energy supply and stability**
    1. Unreliable power grids
        - Many regions experience frequent power outages and voltage fluctuations, making it challenging to run high performance computing systems consistently.
            - This also increases the risk of frying the computational systems
    2. High energy costs
        - Wherever power is available , the cost of running systems  that  consume high ammounts of power can be expensive in the long run
            - the best solution is either going off grid or having a government agreement for subsidised energy costs.
                - GOing off grid can also be expensive to to high initial cost of solar and other off grid solutions and also the large ammounts of power required may not be sustainable.
                - Also harnessing these energy solutions requires technical expertise and may
                
2. **Physical infrastructure**
    1. Limited data centres
        - There are few data centres mostly owned by large corporates for their own uses.
        - The others are concentrated in urban centres leaving vast rural areas underserved.
    2. Aging hardware and facilities
        - In many institutions the existing computational hardware is outdated making it inefficient for modern AI workloads.
        - Also the fast evolution of tech may render even the newest solutons irellevant in the next few years making it a risky investment.
    3. High import costs
        - Acquiring the latest compute is expensive due to import duties, shipping costs and limited local manufacturing of advanced hardware
        
3. **Connectivity and networking.**
    1. Internet bandwidth and latency
        - High speed reliable internet i crucial for accessing cloud services and remote computational resources.
        - This combined with the fact that most rural areas either suffer from lack of internet or bad connectivity limits the number of data centers that can be built.
    2. Limited fiber optic networks
        - There are a limited fibre optic networks and those available are controlled by large parastatals (safaricom)
            - For this though we can do a partnership with safaricom to build datacenters and import compute.
    
4. **Economic & investment barriers**
    1. Insufficient funding
        - Govt and local institutions have liimited budgets for tech upgrades with these investments competing with other needs.
            - This puts the investment in digital upgrades in last place due to constraints and often requires external funding.
    2. Dependence on foreign investment
        - Most local investors mostly invest in tangible assets like land and properties and are risk averse thus they dont invest in tech or intangible assets like bitcoin etc.
        - Most of the available funding comes form international sources which donâ€™t always align with local needs or long term dev strategies
    3. Cost of cloud services.
        - While cloud computing is a good alternative to building physical infrastructure, high data costs and inconsistent connectivity makes these services less accessible
    
5. **Human capital and skills**
    1. Technical expertise: 
        - There is a shortage of local experts trained in maintaining and optimizing complex computational  systems and data centers
            - Those that are trained are expensive and this makes it difficult for small startups to build themselves with expensive labour costs.
    2. Brain drain:
        - most local talent also seeks employment from better paying roles in other developed regions limiting the local capacity to develop.
6. **Policy, regulation and governance**
    1. Lack of supportive policies.
        - The national policies may not sufficiently incentivize the development of digital infrastructure or create and enabling environment for private investments.
            - Lets take kenya for example. Political instability and high taxation make it a less lucrative opportunity for private investors.
    2. Regulatory hurdles:
        - COmplex unclear regulations can hinder rapid deployment of new infrastructure projects
            - For example the cryptic and obscure taxes we pay and regular visits from city council representatives seeking bribes causes hurdles in tech advancement in the country.
            - Also government personalities with personal vendettas may deliberately sabotage private companies to insure their personal gains .
7. **Urban rural divide**
    1. Uneven development
        - Even within kenya urban areas are vastly different from the rural areas in terms of infrastructure like roads, schools and hospitals and even network and internet connectivity.
            - THis makes it difficult to develop these places.
        - Scalability issues:
            - Also building the infrastructue for reliable high perfromance computing and connectivity poses logistical challenges and requires custom solutions that are expensive.
            
8. **Long term development and sustainability.**
    1. Maintenance and upgrades:
        - Building new infrastructure is only the firs step, ongoing maintenance, regular upgrades and sustainable practices are essential for long-term success.
    2. Environmental impact:
        - Expanding data centers and computational power needs to consider environmental impacts such as heat generation and energy consumption which require innovative cooling and energy saving soluions.
            - This combined with the green economy brings a unique problem of making sure we maintain the environment while using high power compute facilities.
