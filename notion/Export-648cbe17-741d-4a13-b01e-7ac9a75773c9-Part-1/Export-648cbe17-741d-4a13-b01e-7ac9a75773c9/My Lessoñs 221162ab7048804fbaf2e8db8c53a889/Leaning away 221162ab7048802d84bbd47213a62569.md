# Leaning away.

- I have just realized that when I'm working and I face a challenge/hardship I tend to lean away, seeking distraction from social media like Ig, YouTube, TikTok and playing pubg. I do this thing where I'm in and out of the work, doing a little work and distracting myself. This inhibits my ability to get into a flow state. What should Ã­ do?
