# This paper is all about my research into the problem of compute access in Africa.

- Most resources in AI development when it comes to compute go into data collection if the data isnt available.
- If the data is available as with most first world countries where there is a lot of historic data to play with, the huge chunk of resources and compute go into __pre-training__ the model.
- This is due to a plethra of reasons, but majorly due to the large ammounts of data used to develop complex systems that are able to model more complex functions of real life, the compute cost also sky- rockets due to the vast ammounts of calculations that have to be done.
- This along with multiple testing and iterating the model increase the costs even more.
