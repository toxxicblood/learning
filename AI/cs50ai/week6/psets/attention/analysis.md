- How can the net [MASK] of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?
- While the chef prepared a fusion of traditional spices and modern culinary techniques, the audience eagerly awaited a taste of [MASK].
- the young boy watched the man with a telescope [MASK] taking out the trash.

## Layer 1, Head 3

## Layer 1, Head 5

Here now the words are starting to realise the connections between words.
Also particular attention is paid to the masked object.

- despite the heavy rain, the determined runners continued their race along the slippery, [MASK] road.
- How can the net [MASK] of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?

- the young boy watched the man with a telescope [MASK] taking out the trash.

## Layer 1, Head 8

- the young boy watched the man with a telescope [MASK] taking out the trash.
