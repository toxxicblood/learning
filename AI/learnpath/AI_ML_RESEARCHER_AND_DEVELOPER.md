# AI AND MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCHER AND DEVELOPER
    - AI and ML research involves designing and refining systems through data to solve problems, make or help make decisions and uncover patterns.
    ### Areas of expertise:
        1. Mathematics 
        2. Programming
        3. Data analysis
        4. Algorithms
    
    ### Key tasks:
        1. Research and development of AI and ML systems: eg creating architectures like transformers or diffusion models.
        2. Oprimising models: improve efficiency, scalability and interpretability of ml models.
        3. Data collection and analysis: collect, clean, and preprocess data to train and test the models. Also building datasets to evaluate performance.
        4. Explore new learning paradims: eg reinforcement learning, self supervised learning or neuromorphic computing.
    
    -Because AI systems cannot innovate autonomously, they rely on researchers to identify limitations, and develop new techniques to overcome them.

    - For Ml and DL it is necessary to understand data science to be able to work with the data used to train these models.

    ## DATA SCIENCE TOOLS USED IN AI:
       1. python libraries:
           - NumPy
           - pandas
           - Matplotlib
           - Scikit-learn
           - seaborn
        
        2. SQL querying and databases for structured data.
        3. Data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, or D3.js.
        4. Jupyter Notebooks for experimenting with data and models.
